======================

Clear Column for tweetdeck 3.3.3


replace these two files in the htdocs/web

* mustaches/mustaches.aa21106663.js
* scripts/swift/app/main.260c973d55.js

And the clear column action will appear in the title bar.

It doesn't override the 'mark all as read' action on messages, so on that column you will still need to open the column.

Otherwise, it uses the 'mark all as read' icon for the clear action.
